Scine i've been using VSCode and now especially after having extended VScode to support our new favortie language Spin2 (Spin for the P2) I have found a number of VScode Extensions useful when writing Spin2 and Pasm2 code. 

Here's the list I find really helpful:

| Name | Context | Description |
|------------|--------|--------|
| Error Lens | code work | bring error messages up into your code for quicker understanding, fixing<br>**usernamehw.errorlens** |
| Hex Editor | code work | view and edit binary files || peacock | many open contexts at same time | for coloring open workspaces |

| Explorer Exclude| code work | Enable hiding of file types within File Explorer panel<br>**redvanworkshop.explorer-exclude-vscode-extension**|
| Version Lens | typescript, javascript, npm projects, etc.| annotates your project dependancies with latest versions and up-to-date status for each<br>**pflannery.vscode-versionlens** |
| Serial Monitor | interact with your P2 similar to using PST (**Propeller Serial Terminal**) | connects your keyboard and display to your P2 serial port<br>**ms-vscode.vscode-serial-monitor** |

If you have VSCode extensions that have really helped you in your P2 development and wish for them to be shown here please file in [ISSUE](https://github.com/ironsheep/P2-vscode-extensions/issues) with this project or [create and file a Pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests) adding the information to this document.  This is done by forking my repository to make a copy of your own. Modifying yours by adding the information you wish to add. Committing the changes to your repo copy, and then filing a pull request to my repo from yours.  I'll complete the action by reviewing your changes and then committing them to my repo.

Lastly, you could PM [me in the Paralax forums](https://forums.parallax.com/profile) and tell me there. (_this link will fail if you are not logged in to the forums_)
